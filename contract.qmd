## Project Overview:

This project focuses on compiling and analyzing statistical data for a diverse range of 278 crop and livestock products. The dataset will be expressed in key indicators like production quantities, yields, and processed product outputs, making it a valuable resource for understanding global agricultural production patterns across crops and livestock industries.

### Expected Deliverables:

- Proposal
- Data Visualizations
- Data Analysis
- Project Presentation
- Final Write-Up
- Peer Reviews

### Team Goals:

- Assess global food production with respect to regions.
- Analyze the climate effect on crop production.

### Learning Objectives:

1. Collect and transform agricultural data effectively for analysis.
2. Uncover patterns and trends in crop and livestock production.
3. Analyze long-term trends, seasonality, and cyclic patterns in agricultural data.
4. Create visualizations to communicate insights (e.g., line charts, heatmaps).
5. Build interactive dashboards and geographical visualizations.
6. Conduct correlation analysis and hypothesis testing on production data.
7. Develop reports and presentations with actionable insights.
